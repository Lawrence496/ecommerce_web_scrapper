# ecommerce_web_scrapper
This is a functional web scraping script using Python, incorporating features like handling dynamic content, user-agent rotation, and writing data to a CSV file.

This script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, and fake_useragent to generate random User-Agent headers to mimic different browsers. It also introduces a delay between requests to avoid being blocked by the website. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file. The script scraps for Amazon products using the listed libraries. Remember to install the respective libraries using "pip install requests beautifulsoup4 fake-useragent".
